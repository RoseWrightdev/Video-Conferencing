# Global Agent Instructions

## Test Driven Development (TDD)
You must always strictly follow Test Driven Development (TDD) for all coding tasks.
1. **Red**: Write a failing test first. Do not write any implementation code until you have a test that fails for the expected reason.
2. **Green**: Write the minimal amount of code necessary to make the test pass.
3. **Refactor**: Clean up the code while ensuring tests still pass.
4. **Check**: @current_problems to ensure the LSP isn't reporting any errors or warnings.
